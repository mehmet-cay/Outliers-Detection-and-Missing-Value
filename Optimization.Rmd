# Data Optimization

Numbers in our data could be very big. In order to compute easily, we should do some optimization to our data.

## Min-Max Optimization

What we do is substracting min elements of our data from each element, then we need to divide each result to differences between max element and minimum element.
Here is the formula: $(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))$

```{r}
minMaxNorm <- function(x){
  return((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}

minMaxNorm(iris$Sepal.Length)
```
as it can be seen, all variables squeezed between 0 and 1

## Scaling
Our formula is $(x - \hat{x})/s)$, which
$x$ :our data, 
$\hat{x}$: mean of data,
$s$: standard deviation.

```{r}
scaling <- scale(iris$Sepal.Length,center = T,scale = T)
head(scaling)
```
